# Exclude both end-to-end tiers from pytest collection. tests/playwright/
# holds browser-driven tests (Playwright), and tests/e2e/ holds heavier

collect_ignore = ["e2e", "playwright"]

# REPO_HYGIENE_FILTERS is the repo-local hygiene-exclusion registry (Layer 2).
# file_utils.discover_files reads it from this conftest, which is the right
# home because propagation only merges the collect_ignore block above into this
# file; the rest of conftest survives and may differ per repo. Vendored files
# (file_utils.py and every tests/test_*.py) get overwritten by propagation,
# so they must hold no repo-specific data. Put repo-specific exclusions here.
#
# Shape and rules:
#   - It is a dict: key -> list of repo-relative POSIX glob patterns.
#   - Keys are "all" or a vendored test key. A test key is the test filename
#     stem with the leading "test_" removed (test_pyflakes_code_lint.py ->
#     "pyflakes_code_lint", test_ascii_compliance.py -> "ascii_compliance").
#   - Patterns match repo-relative POSIX paths via fnmatch.fnmatchcase
#     (case-sensitive). A match excludes the file from that test.
#   - "all" patterns apply to every test; a test-key list applies only when
#     that test_key is passed to discover_files.
#   - Recursive directory exclusions need an explicit /** because fnmatch's *
#     does not cross "/". Use "temp_scripts/**" to exclude a whole subtree.
#
# This template has no repo-specific exclusions, so the registry is empty.
# Example entries (commented out; this repo needs none):
#   REPO_HYGIENE_FILTERS = {
#       "all": ["temp_scripts/**", "TEMPLATE.py"],
#       "ascii_compliance": ["human_readable-*.html"],
#       "pyflakes_code_lint": ["devel/scratch_*.py"],
#   }
REPO_HYGIENE_FILTERS = {}
