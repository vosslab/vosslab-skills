# PySide6 UI Engineer

## Overview

Use this skill to build desktop interfaces that are technically sound and pleasant to use.
Balance PySide6 implementation details with product-level UI/UX judgment instead of treating visuals as an afterthought.
Use the official Qt for Python docs as the primary source for APIs, examples, and tool behavior.

## Workflow

1. Classify the surface before coding.
- Decide whether the work belongs in Qt Widgets or Qt Quick first, then decide whether it should use a `QMainWindow`, `QWidget`, `QDialog`, wizard, dock layout, or model/view surface.
- Identify the primary user goal, the main workflow path, and the states that must be handled: loading, empty, valid, invalid, busy, success, and failure.
- Read [`references/official_qt_for_python_docs.md`](references/official_qt_for_python_docs.md) when you need the official entry points for installation, module lookup, tutorials, examples, or package tools.

2. Choose a structure that keeps state understandable.
- Prefer a small composition tree of widgets over a giant window class.
- Keep business logic separate from widget layout logic.
- Use signals, slots, and small controller-style helpers to avoid tightly coupling every widget to every other widget.
- Read [`references/pyside6_patterns.md`](references/pyside6_patterns.md) when choosing between common widget, dialog, navigation, threading, and model/view patterns.
- Read [`references/signals_slots.md`](references/signals_slots.md) when designing event flow, widget coordination, worker updates, or signal boundaries.

3. Build the UI from layout and hierarchy first.
- Prefer layouts over absolute positioning.
- Make visual hierarchy obvious with spacing, grouping, alignment, and restrained emphasis.
- Keep forms short, labels explicit, and primary actions visually dominant.
- Design for resizing from the start; do not assume one fixed window size.
- Read [`references/model_view.md`](references/model_view.md) before building non-trivial tables, trees, filtering, sorting, or custom cell rendering.

4. Add interaction quality, not just functionality.
- Give immediate feedback for user actions.
- Prevent errors before showing errors.
- Keep destructive actions explicit and reversible when practical.
- Support keyboard flow, sensible tab order, and accessible names/tooltips where needed.
- Read [`references/ui_ux_review.md`](references/ui_ux_review.md) when polishing hierarchy, affordances, validation, empty states, feedback, and accessibility.
- Read [`references/design_books.md`](references/design_books.md) when you need durable design heuristics, typography guidance, grid/layout thinking, or design-system perspective beyond immediate PySide6 mechanics.
- Read the local top-three design resources in this order when they match the problem:
  [`references/Refactoring_UI.txt`](references/Refactoring_UI.txt) for visual hierarchy, spacing, typography, color, and component polish;
  [`references/Practical_UI.txt`](references/Practical_UI.txt) for logic-driven accessibility, interaction, and usability rules;
  [`references/About_Face.txt`](references/About_Face.txt) for flow, task structure, dialog behavior, and interaction model decisions.
- Read [`references/About_Face.txt`](references/About_Face.txt) when the flow, task structure, dialog behavior, or interaction model feels weak rather than merely looking weak.

5. Verify behavior with a UX review pass.
- Check whether the screen communicates purpose in three seconds.
- Check whether the main action is obvious.
- Check whether busy work has been removed from the user's path.
- Check whether edge states look intentional rather than broken.

## Implementation defaults

- Prefer Qt Widgets for classic desktop productivity tools, forms, settings, inspectors, admin panels, and other dense business UIs.
- Use Qt Quick only when the product genuinely needs a more fluid, animated, or QML-centric surface and the request clearly points there.
- Prefer `QMainWindow` for multi-region applications with menus, toolbars, docks, or status bars.
- Prefer `QDialog` for short focused tasks that need confirmation or cancellation.
- Prefer `QStackedWidget` or a router/controller pattern for multi-step flows when tabs would expose too much complexity.
- Prefer Qt's model/view classes for tables, trees, and large changing datasets.
- Keep long-running work off the UI thread; use worker objects plus `QThread` or other Qt-safe async patterns.
- Treat stylesheets as a finishing layer, not a substitute for good widget choice and layout structure.
- Prefer official Qt tools when the task involves `.ui`, `.qrc`, or project-generation workflows instead of reinventing those steps by hand.
- Read [`references/designer_ui_workflow.md`](references/designer_ui_workflow.md) when `.ui` files, Qt Designer, or `pyside6-uic` are involved.
- Read [`references/deployment_and_packaging.md`](references/deployment_and_packaging.md) when the task includes packaging, shipping, or validating a distributable PySide6 app.

## Quality bar

- Favor clarity over decoration.
- Favor stable patterns over clever widget tricks.
- Favor predictable state transitions over hidden side effects.
- Avoid cramped layouts, unlabeled icons, ambiguous submit buttons, and dialogs that ask questions without context.
- Do not block the event loop with expensive work, sleeps, or synchronous network/file operations in click handlers.

## Output expectations

When using this skill, aim to produce:
- PySide6 code that is organized by responsibility and easy to extend.
- UI decisions that can be defended in terms of user goals, not personal taste.
- Explicit handling for validation, error messaging, empty states, and loading states.
- A short explanation of key UX decisions when the change is non-obvious.
- References to the relevant official Qt for Python docs when using unfamiliar APIs or package tools.
